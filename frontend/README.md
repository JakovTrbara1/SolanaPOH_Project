# PoH Visualizer Frontend

Angular 17 workspace that will host the Solana Proof of History train visualization. It currently renders a placeholder page so you can verify the toolchain boots correctly once dependencies are installed.

## Scripts

- `npm start` – Serve the Angular app on `http://localhost:4200`.
- `npm run build` – Produce a production build in `dist/`.
- `npm test` – Run unit tests once they are added.

Bootstrap 5 is wired in globally through `angular.json` and `styles.scss`.
